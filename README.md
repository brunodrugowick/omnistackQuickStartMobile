# React Native Quick Start

This app uses [this backend](https://github.com/brunodrugowick/omnistack-quick-start-backend) and mimics [this frontend](https://github.com/brunodrugowick/omnistack-quick-start-frontend) on a very cool and addictive two-weeks project that I decided to do.

## Developing

Use `react-native run-android` to install and test the application with you device connected. There are other commands but I'll have to refer to the documentation myself and I suggest you do the same. Sorry! Hahahaha.
